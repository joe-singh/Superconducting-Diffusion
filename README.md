# Diffusion Model Driven By A Superconducting Circuit

Colab notebook for the diffusion with superconducting noise project. 

The noise file for the superconducting resonator used in the above code is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z9qNoB39jVkjScfo9nQj7guVqWpsVU3T/view?usp=sharing
The Lorentzian profile looks like this, with a quality factor of ~5e6.
